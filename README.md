# A simple Astro boilerplate with CUBE CSS and TailwindCSS

Based on the [CUBE CSS Boilerplate](https://github.com/Set-Creative-Studio/cube-boilerplate). 

The Astro CUBE CSS Boilerplate is a simple, modern, web platform native starting point with sensible defaults. You get the advantages of modern CSS, with the aid of utility classes, and the affordances of design token architecture. 

Uses:
- [Astro](https://astro.build/), a web framework for content-driven websites
- [Cube CSS](https://cube.fyi/), a pragmatric and simple CSS methodology
- [Every Layouts](https://every-layout.dev/), better, more resilient CSS
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a utility-first CSS framework, used as utility-second
- Design tokens
